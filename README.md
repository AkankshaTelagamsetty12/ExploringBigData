# ExploringBigData

Analysed SEVIR and Storm Datasets and visualized the data using Big Query on Data Studio.
Datasets: 
Sevir Data: The Storm EVent ImagRy (SEVIR) dataset is a collection of temporally and spatially aligned images containing weather events captured by satellite and radar. Each of these "events" consists of 4 hours of data in 5 minute time increments over a 384 km x 384 km patch sampled somewhere over the US. Each event is SEVIR is captured by up to 5 image types.

Storm Data:  Contains information about events occurred between 1950 and 2021  as entered by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS).
